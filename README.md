# VIGIL_Forecasting_Prep

This code is part of a project I undertook in July 2022 at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL, where I attempted to correlate high speed solar wind streams and geomagnetic storms, and create an advance warning and forecasting system from satellite data at the L5 point.


###Â This is an exploratory attempt to:
1. Download the data from the satellites STEREO A and B, OMNI, GOES, and the DST. 
2. Correlate datasets and analyse the time shifts between STEREO and OMNI and OMNI and GOES
3. Plot the various solar wind and electron flux parameters
4. Create a basic forecasting algorithm to predict high levels of electron flux by measuring the solar wind
5. Use statistical methods such as ROC curves to analyse the predictability of the datasets
